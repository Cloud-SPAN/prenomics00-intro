[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) at the University of York and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award. It aims to train researchers to effectively generate and analyse a range of 'omics data using Cloud computing resources.

This Prenomics module is designed to prepare people for the [Cloud-SPAN Genomics course](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk/train-with-us#genomicscourse). We have found that people taking the Genomics module can vary the amount of experience they have had in navigating file systems and using the command line. We have designed the Prenomics module to allow more time for those with less experience to cover some foundation concepts. We have a [Self-assessment Quiz](https://shiny.york.ac.uk/er13/prenomics-quiz/#section-why) to help you decide if you would benefit from attending Prenomics before the Genomics module.

The Prenomics and Genomics modules are based on the Data Carpentry's [Genomics Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/).

Prenomics teaches the basics of command-line programming, including: (1) file directory structure, (2) use of command-line utilities to connect to and use cloud computing and storage resources and (3) basic shell commands for file navigation and basic script writing.

The module is designed to be taught over two half days of instruction.

> ## Getting Started

# Overview

| Lesson                     | Overview |
| -------------------------- | ---------|
| [Files and directories](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics01-file-directories/) |Learn about files and directories, log onto a cloud instance and get a basic introduction to the shell.|
| [Using the command line](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics02-command-line/)  |Learn more about using the shell to navigate directories, manipulate and search files and use basic loops to iterate commands.|

# Before a tutor-led course

You will need a shell. Please follow the directions in the [Setup](setup).
