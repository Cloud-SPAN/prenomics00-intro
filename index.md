[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a project run by the Biology Department of the University of York with the aim to develop advanced modules covering specialised knowledge and skills to generate and analyse 'omics data using cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

This 'Prenomics' course is partly based on the Data Carpentry's [Genomics Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/), streamlined to serve as a foundation course for Cloud-SPAN's Genomics and Advanced modules.

The course teaches the basics of command-line programming, including: (1) file directory structure, (2) use of command-line utilities to connect to and use cloud computing and storage resources and (3) basic shell commands for file navigation and basic script writing.

The course is designed to be taught over two half days of instruction.
